## Introduction
This OnShape project is a part of an french engineering school project (**Grenoble INP - Génie Industriel**) realized during 2022/2023. During 1 year, our group of 5 students had to make a machine prototype which would automatize the manufacturing of connecting wire for prototyping  named “jumper” from a wire reel. It was ordered by the **Ense3 Favlab** and realized on the **Smart Platform**.

We also own an OnShape file with all our CAD models and assemblies
