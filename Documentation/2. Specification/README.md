# **Specification**

In order to best meet the customer's needs, we felt it was more efficient to ask him directly what he wanted from our machine. To do this, we drew up a first set of specifications and sent them to him. This was followed by several email exchanges and corrections to the specifications. We were also able to prioritize the functions of the machine from the most important to the least important with the customer. We also integrated a method of verification for each function (visual method, on software, by measurement, etc). To date, here are our main objectives.

## **Main objectives of this project**

First of all, the machine must distribute rigid wire. It must therefore be fed with wire, tension the wire and make it circulate in the system. The tensioned wire must not deviate from its initial axis by more than 1 millimeter.

Then, the machine must cut the wire to the right length and in bizot (45 degree angle). The length of wire to be cut ranges from 5.08 to 50.8 mm with a pitch of 2.54 mm with a tolerance of 0.5 mm. Here is the nomenclature of a jumper to make it clearer :

As for the removal of the sleeve, it must be done on the left and right parts of the cut wire on a length of 6.5 mm on each side with a tolerance of 0.5 mm. This step must be done with care in order not to damage the conductors. We have also thought of a sorting system in order to differentiate between the waste of the sleeve and the waste of the conductor wire.

For the bending part of the machine, the edges of the wires must be bent at 90° with a tolerance of 5°, and above all they must not modify the initial geometry of the wire, that is to say that the wire must remain straight.

Then, for the operation of the machine, the customer would like it to be powered by different sources (nomadic mode, 12v DC) and to withstand the temperature conditions of a laboratory. Moreover, the machine must also respect a rate of 1 jumper in 10 seconds. It must be reliable, i.e. it must produce at least 10 jumpers in a row that comply with the specifications mentioned above. But the machine must also be dismountable and mountable with simple tools in one hour maximum.

As far as safety is concerned, the customer would like the machine to stop completely in less than one second with a simple manipulation. Also, if the instructions are not followed, the machine should not start. Moreover, during its operation no moving part of the system should be reachable by the user.

Finally, for the spatial dimensions, the system must not exceed the dimensions L50*W30*H30 cm and must not weigh more than 15 Kg.

  
## **1. Stakeholders:**
<details>
  <summary>Click to see the guideline!</summary>
  
- **Definition:** *Stakeholders generally refer to all the actors (human and non-human) who have an interest in a product. Among the stakeholders, there are both internal players, such as users and participants of the project, and external players that are represented by the potential user of products or external entities.*

- **Comments:**

  - *A stakeholder is not necessarily a person (e.g. considering airports as a stakeholder when designing a two-deck aircraft).*
  - *A stakeholder can indirectly affect the product (e.g. considering neighborhood when designing a nuclear power plant).*
  - *A stakeholder can indirectly be affected by the product (e.g. considering the local biodiversity when designing an airport).*

## 3. Service *(synonyms: external function, capability)* 
<details>
  <summary>Click to see the guideline!</summary>
  
- **Definition:** *A service is an effect intended by a stakeholder resulting from the interaction of the product with its environment (i.e. what the  product is for).*

- **Comments:**
  - *Services provide users with an exchange value that can be included in an economic system (e.g. airlines buy flight hours).*
  - *Services are intended effects that can be observed from outside the product ("black box" external view), but not from outside an internal component ("white box" internal view).*
  - *Services are defined in a solution neutral-way.*
  - *Services can be stated as follows: The [Product] shall enable [Stakeholder] [Action verb] (e.g. The product shall enable end-user to clean its teeth)*
  - *we often reason in terms of action verbs to communicate expected behaviors, so it would be nice to be able to search designs with action verbs*

  <summary>Click to see the guideline!</summary>
  
- **Definition:**  *A constraint is a choice that makes certain designs "not allowed" or inappropriate for their intended use.*

- **Comments:**

  - *The constraint is a restriction, limit, or regulation imposed on a product.*
  - *There are two kinds of constraints: input constraints and system constraints.* 
    - *Input constraints are imposed as part of the design specifications.*
    - *System constraints are constraints imposed by the system in which the design solution must function.*

  Example of the functional requirement that ADD-ONS of XYZ cargo provides for the food producers, as a stakeholder, to preserve the quality of food.
 
  In this example, we assumed a refrigerator on the ADD-ONS could help the food producers to cool down and preserve the temperature of food. 
  
  So, we defined some  functional requirements (FR) based on this assumption that consist:
 
    - FR1: To maintain the quality of food, the food producer needs to main the material at cold temperature (between 3 °C and 10 °C) for short-term preservation (3h) or long-term preservation (24h).
    - FR2: ADD-ONS shall fix the internal ADD-ONS temperature for 7 °C.
    - FR3: To create a cold ambient in the cooling down system, the ADD-ONS shall compress the low temperature and pressured gas to start the cooling cycle.
    - FR4: the cooling down system shall control the pressure of exit hot gas 
    - FR5: the hot and pressured exit gas needs to meet the cooler external ambient temperature to become a liquid.
    - ...
