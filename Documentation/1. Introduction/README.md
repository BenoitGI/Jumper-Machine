# Introduction

![Final prototype](https://github.com/BenoitGI/Jumper-Machine-/blob/main/Sources/Images/Final%20prototype.jpg)

## Motivation

Our project focuses on a jumper cutting and stripping machine.
This machine should be used in schools (above all Ense3) for learning and research purposes.
Its main functions will be to cut jumpers for electrical devices such as breadboards and strip the jumpers out of their protective wire sleeve.

## Goals

The main purpose of this machine is to allow students and researchers to work faster.
Indeed, cutting jumpers, stripping them and bending them takes time.
According to the client, the main issue with doing these tasks by hand is the inaccuracies of the jumper’s length and the jumpers not being bent correctly.
Indeed, the corners of the jumper are usually not straight but curved toward its center. This curve makes it difficult to place the jumpers on the breadboard. 

So the first challenge is to straighten and harden the corners of the jumpers.
Then, the jumper’s length is also difficult to get right by hand.
If the jumper is too long it will bend or create knots with the other jumpers, whereas if it is too short, it won’t fit in the dedicated space.
Also when the jumper’s length is not right, the electrical contacts are not made or badly made.

## History

The project originated from a researcher, Frédéric Mantegazza.

## Required skills

To reproduce or modify the cutting machine, it is necessary to know the basic mechanics as well as the electronics and coding related to the Arduino.
This product has been intentionnally designed to be manufactured in any fablab with cutting machines and 3D printers.

## Contribution Process

The machine will be delivered to the Ense3 FABLAB and will be tested currently under test by various people.
An improved version will certainly be welcome in a near future.
