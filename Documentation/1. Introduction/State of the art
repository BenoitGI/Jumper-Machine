  Since a few decades, human beings have been using wires, especially jumpers, for electronic systems and often need to cut and strip them. That’s why they have created both wire cutter and wire stipper, then he wanted to do both those tasks with only one tool. Today, there are machines which can automatically cut and strip wires. They can either be big industrial machines or homemade ones depending on making rate, quantity, … It’s also possible for some machines to bend wires in order to make jumpers.



Using wire stipper or special blades can be considered as the main way to get stripped wires even though a carbon-dioxide laser is a good solution as well. However, a carbon-dioxide laser is very expensive thus outside the budget. The last solution to strip a wire we thought about consisted in using chemicals to dissolve the wire sleeve but we have quickly forgotten this solution because of its dangerousness.

About bending, there are many existing solutions and not only the basic one by using a plier but also, for example, an interesting and uncommon way with a hot wire. On the Internet, most bending machines work with a spinning part (linked to a stepper) and an offset axis.
			
A wire cutting machine “typically feeds the wire in on a reel, marks the wire using an inkjet or hot stamp printing mechanism, cuts the wire, and then coils the finished product on another reel or stacks it in a guide channel” [2].
A wire cutting/stripping machine usually has a rotating blade that follows the input cable and strips or cuts away the insulation.
However, such tools are expensive, and can’t be afforded by small workshops. For example, the Model WS-212 wire stripping machine by Bluerock Tools costs $ 1,299.00. Moreover the machine weighs 90 kilograms which is not convenient to be carried. The main issue with old wire cutting machines is the fact that they are not accurate or reliable. They tend to waste material which is an important issue when you are doing a project for the school of the environment.

Before the appearance of the first machines for cutting and stripping electrical wires, these tasks had to be done manually. Thanks to the particular shape of its blades, the "classic" cutting pliers can easily cut wires of various diameters.






For the stripping pliers, there are more or less sophisticated models. A calibrated wire stripper is very interesting for stripping small diameter wires, but its range of action is limited by its size. Indeed, the more it is possible to use it for different wires, the more it will be cumbersome. For this reason, it is sometimes interesting to have a second stripper at one's disposal to strip wires with a larger diameter.















Stripping a wire is based on the principle of two blades that partially cut a sleeve that surrounds the electrical wires. Then pull to detach a piece of the sleeve. However, it may be interesting to be inspired by the principle of a foil cutter. That is to say, to have a device equipped with four rotating circular blades that can cut the sleeve around the wires completely.


The use of blades to cut and strip wires is certainly the most common because of its simplicity, its low risk of injury but especially its very low cost compared to other devices. 


It is possible to perform these cutting and stripping tasks automatically with machines made by professionals [3] and usually sold at high prices. However, many individuals wish to have such machines to make their own jumpers. That's why there are DIY machines [4] with tutorials available online so you can make them yourself. All of these machines work in much the same way. The wire first passes through a tensioning system which also allows to straighten it. It’s then pulled by rollers which, according to their direction of rotation, make the wire advance or retreat. Finally, these machines use two V-shaped blades capable of cutting and stripping the wire. The whole thing is often managed by an Arduino type board that controls stepper motors. Finally, the use of such machines allows to cut and strip wires much faster than with pliers. It is especially possible to manufacture some of them for a lower cost.


V-blade technology is not the only technology that can be used for wire stripping. In fact, some individuals have already built their own machines and used a laser to strip the wires.


You might wonder why should a laser be considered for this purpose when the equipment is significantly more expensive than the competing methods?
The answer lies in its easy integration with electromechanical equipment, high controllability, non-contact process and no cutting force on the workpiece. Previous researches have proved that laser means has absolute advantages over traditional ways of mechanical wire stripping. [5]


Currently, carbon dioxide lasers are used on stripping machines because of their ability to selectively remove only the insulation without damaging the wire.
The absorption coefficient of non-metal material for this kind of laser wavelength is high and the absorption coefficient of metal material for this kind of laser wavelength is low, so the metal layer will not be damaged.
Laser wire stripping has been effectively applied as a production process in the aerospace, medical and data communications fields. There are specific advantages of using a laser over other methods but the emphasis varies from application to application.

Advantages : 
Selectively removes insulation with no conductor damage.
Near perfect process yield.
Lowest rework costs.
Provides excellent wire integrity, significantly increasing product life and reliability.
Can be automated, reducing labor costs.



Lasers have become valuable tools in manufacturing. Laser wire stripping is now performing production requirements very satisfactorily. The companies requiring wire stripping can now use lasers for this purpose and have various processes that cover all insulation materials presently in use.

Drawbacks :
High component costs.
If not fully automated, need for protection for users (closed carter and protective eyewear).
Need for a ventilation system to avoid accumulation of toxic fumes.


In the 2000s, NASA developed a manufacturing standard for wire stripping using chemical agents [6] . This method can only be used for single-conductor wires, but it is effective and allows a clean stripping without sleeve residues. However, the use of such chemical agents remains dangerous even if it seems to be possible to buy professional chemical pots [7] that enable the user to strip wires by using the method with chemical agents.



In order to bend the wires in the least complex way possible, one would simply use pliers to bend the stripped ends into the desired jumper shape. The disadvantage of this method is that it is not very fast, it can be a pain for smaller wires and it does not allow a good regularity of the jumper shape. On the other hand, it is possible to consider 3D printing a bending die allowing to deposit the wires according to the corresponding size, then to press on the edges in order to bend them. This method could also be semi-automated or even totally automated by considering two dies (female and male) that would perform the bending and would overcome some of the shortcomings of the entirely manual method.


The most commonly used solution for bending wires is to use a part controlled by a stepper motor and equipped with an eccentric and extruded cylinder. There are many machines with different designs. Indeed, some are arranged horizontally [8] and others vertically [9] . It does not seem that either of these operating modes offers any particular advantages. The majority of the machines only allow folding. However, there are some machines that are able to perform all three tasks at once [10] .

The last possible method is probably one of the least used, but it is quite possible to bend wires using an electrically heated wire [11] . It works in much the same way as the bending die, but the effort required to bend the wire is reduced. The main disadvantage of this technique is obviously the risk of burning.
