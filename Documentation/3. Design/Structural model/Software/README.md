## **Man-machine interface**

Creating a HMI was an important step to ensure the machine is usable. It allows the user to change the parameters of the machine without changing the code. Different menus were set up to change those values: for the number of jumpers to cut, for their length and for the positioning of the blade to strip the wire. Also two more menus were added: one to feed the wire once it’s in the extruder (avoiding a tedious task by hand) and the menu to start the program to make jumpers. A joystick can change menus vertically and change the values of the menus concerned horizontally, once entered with the button of this joystick. To see that information, a simple 16x2 screen was added for the precise information, and three LEDs were added: green when everything is functioning and it’s fine to manipulate the machine, orange when everything is functioning but one or both motors are functioning, and red when wire is missing.
